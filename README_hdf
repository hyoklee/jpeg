The files for building libjpeg were moved into src and examples directories to 
facilitate building with cmake.  Consequently, to allow building libjpeg with 
autotools using the same source tarfile, Makefile.ams were added to those 
directories, configure.ac was updated for the added files and for changed 
location of jpeglib.h, and the following process was used to generate 
Makefile.ins:

1. Running current versions of autoconf, autoheader and automake caused errors 
when processing configure.ac.  Using versions close to those specified in the 
original files was more successful.  To do that, PATH was set to 
/mnt/hdf/packages/autoconf/autoconf-2.68/bin:/mnt/hdf/packages/automake/
automake-1.11.1/bin:/mnt/hdf/packages/libtool/libtool-2.4.2/bin:/mnt/hdf/
packages/m4/m4-1.4.14/bin:$PATH.  This shouldn't be needed again unless changes 
are made to configure or Makefile.ams.

2. configure expects jconfig.cfg in the top level directory for generating 
jconfig.h.  The original file is available in config/orig_config.  Step 1 
overwrites jconfig.cfg in the top level directory with a new version that 
doesn't enable writing bmp and ppm files, causing make check to fail.  Copying 
the file from config/orig_config to the top directory before running configure 
seems to solve the problem.
